Following a tip off about infiltration of a militant with arms and ammunition into the Indian territory from Bangladesh, an intelligence team of the Border Security Force (BSF) s Meghalaya Frontier, deployed in Tura, had laid a trap and arrested the ULFA cadre from Kachhuadogri, a BSF official said. He said the ULFA cadre disclosed his identity as Peramisom Marak (19) hailing from Sherpur District of Bangladesh. A 9mm pistol, two 9mm magazines, eight 9mm live rounds and a cell phone with Bangladeshi SIM card were recovered from him, the official said. Marak told the BSF that he has been working with ULFA in Bangladesh since the last three years and remains in close association with ULFA s deputy ‘commander in chief’ Dristhi Rajkhowa and his bodyguards. He also transports arms for them and assist ULFA cadres, residing at Badagazni village in Bangladesh, to cross over to India and vice versa with the help of some Indian associates, the official said. He added that Marak was wanted for illegal activities in Bangladesh. The Badagazni area, the official said, is a safe haven for Indian insurgents as they disguise themselves as local tribals living there to avoid arrest. These cadres have a good number of sympathisers in that village. The BSF is now trying to figure out the Indian associates who are providing assistance to these cadres in the border areas, the official said. Marak was later handed over to local Police."
