The place is no more a Maoist stronghold as Police have arrested large number of Maoists from this area in the last few months. The outfit is facing dearth of cadres with no newcomers joining it. Besides, frequent raids to curb illegal coal mining and transportation activities have badly hit their revenue earnings. However, Meena said that there is a chance of Maoists triggering violent incidents in coming days as they are trying to register their presence among people in a big way. The Police have been put on alert for combat. Maoist menace in the area has decreased. The cadres could be hiding in remote areas where penetration of Police forces is less, he said. Meena said that the Maoists at present have confined their presence and movement to Jhumra and Upperghat in Bokaro, Pirtanda, Parasnath and Tundi belt in Giridih and Dhanbad beside Gaya Palamu border areas in Chatra. However the Police Forces are frequently raiding these areas to keep a tab on the developments."

For that, we need to change our strategy and it is the evidence of a fact that militants have understood that there is a pressure on them from security forces,” he told on the sidelines of passing out parade for paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men at Humhama in Budgam District. The Chief Minister said militants want to down the morale of Security Forces (SFs). “And by attacking them, they think their morale is increasing. But this is not the case. Neither does their morale increase nor is the security forces’ morale decreased,” Omar added. “To ensure such incidents don’t take place in future, we have already prepared for that.”"

Times of India quoted an unnamed official as saying that a design flaw in the bombs caused them to explode partially and prevented the shrapnel from spreading. Without naming any group, an unnamed Home Ministry official in New Delhi said there were credible leads pointing to a big plan by a terror outfit. Preliminary forensic result which is an outcome of the detailed examination of the two unexploded IEDs and nature of blasts shows that the bomb had all the ingredients to cause a much bigger impact and had the potential to take lives of many people. Also, in Pune, Police bomb experts who supervised dismantling of the devices also said the four bombs placed on Jangli Maharaj road exploded only partly. Had these and the two that were defused gone off fully, the damage caused would have been major , they said."

The email is among documents, released by the whistleblower website and deemed classified by the CIA, contained reports on Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also ideas for US policy towards Iran. Brennan, three days after Barack Obama was elected US President in November 2008, wrote to him in a position cum strategy paper that Pakistan uses the Taliban to counter India in Afghanistan. Pakistan s desire to counter India s growing influence in Afghanistan and concerns about US long term commitments to Afghanistan increase Pakistan s interest in hedging its bets by ensuring that it will be able to have a working relationship with the Taliban to balance Indian and Iranian interests if the US withdraws, Brennan wrote on November 7, 2008. Brennan, then a top foreign policy and counter terrorism adviser to Obama, then a president elect, was in the running to be CIA Director. Brennan s views on Pakistan was disclosed in a 13 page executive summary of key findings and recommendations on Afghanistan and Pakistan. Brennan, in the summary, said efforts in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) have been challenged by Pakistan s ambivalence towards, and perhaps outright support for, the Taliban. While the US Intelligence Community differs on the extent of the relationships, at least some elements of Pakistan s military and intelligence services appear to be ambivalent about the anti Taliban and anti militant mission in the FATA, in part due to their history of close ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan s conflict with the Soviet Union and Pakistan s use of militant proxies in its conflict with India, he wrote."

4566,False,,,,,,,india,2015,"In what constitutes undeniable evidence of Pakistan s involvement in the terror attack at Dinanagar in Gurdaspur District of Punjab on July 27, the intelligence agencies have found that the Global Positioning System (GPS) sets recovered from the slain terrorists were first fed with data on July 21 at Sargodha in the Punjab Province of Pakistan, reports The Times of India. The examination of GPS sets also shows that the three terrorists were sent with instructions to kill the District Magistrate (DM) and the Superintendent of Police (SP) of Gurdaspur, attack the Dinanagar Police station and inflict mass casualties by blowing up passenger trains. Top Government sources described the data retrieved from the GPS sets as incontrovertible technical evidence of Pakistan s complicity , and expressed confidence that investigators would soon be able to determine the identity of the three attackers. The report said the GPS data shows that the masterminds had set three targets for the terrorists. The first was the Dinanagar Pathankot rail track on which five bombs were found strapped. Dinanagar Police station, where the encounter took place resulting in the terrorists being killed, was the second on the hit list. The terrorists were expected to eventually proceed to the high profile targets of bungalows of the DM and the SP in the Civil Lines area of the town for what could have been a deadly climax. Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) has emerged as the prime suspect behind July 27 terror attack in Gurdaspur in Punjab, adds The Times of India. The modus operandi was reminiscent of the storming of police stations in Jammu and Kashmir (J K), particularly the March attack carried out by LeT in Samba, while the equipment found on the three fidayeen such as GPS device, AK 47s and Chinese grenades, as well as a conscious effort on their part to conceal their identity bore the unmistakable stamp of a Lashkar operation. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) s initial assessment is that the terrorists may have infiltrated from across Pakistan into Kathua, which borders Dinanagar, the site of the attack. It is likely that they were headed for a fidayeen operation in Jammu region, but given the tight security there in the wake of intelligence inputs on LeT s plans to push in two groups of infiltrators into Kathua, they may have found it easier to target an adjoining location in Punjab, a senior Home Ministry official said. The modus operandi terrorists dressed in military fatigues, early morning strike, car jacking, indiscriminate firing and storming of a police station followed by engaging security forces in an encounter had all the elements associated with a typical LeT attack, the official added. UMHA on July 28 claimed that the attack led by three terrorists at Dinanagar Police station in Gurdaspur was a desperate bid by Pakistan s intelligence agency, Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to revive militancy in Punjab, reports Mumbai Mirror. Last week Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) and Chief Secretary were called for a meeting to apprise them of intelligence reports that ISI is making all possible efforts to regroup separatist forces within the state. The Khalistan movement is all but over. Our reports suggested that ISI was making all possible efforts to cajole few remnant separatists but found no support. Their request for logistic support for their men was also not heard. Which is why we believe they sent three fidayeen, a senior MHA official said."

A detailed intelligence dossier prepared by Central agencies in the wake of this incident had also warned that the future threat to India’s internal security could well come from the sea route in Sri Lanka as the ISI, assisted by Pakistani High Commission staff, was trying to increase its anti India operations there."

In an address to the United Nations (UN) that was widely anticipated in the subcontinent because of previews in Pakistan that he would present evidence of India fomenting unrest in Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif came up with zilch. Aside from generically saying neighbors should not foment instability in Pakistan (which could apply to several countries) there were no charges, forget any shred of evidence, which Sharif s National Security Advisor (NSA) and other officials had promised to produce. Instead, it was a familiar lament about how Kashmir has been neglected by the UN and resolutions on the issue had not been taken up, although Pakistan stands in violation of most aspects of the resolution such as vacating Occupied Kashmir. Global threat of terrorism cannot be defeated without addressing the underlying causes, Sharif said, repeating an argument that has been largely discredited as validating terrorism. Without naming India, he said some countries were suppressing the rights of self determination in the name of fighting terrorism. Sharif said he had reached out to the Indian leadership when the new dispensation took over in New Delhi last year but things had gone south with the escalation in border tension in recent days. To avert further escalation, he was proposing a new peace with India with steps, including formalising and respecting the 2003 understanding on ceasefire with a ramped up UNMOGIP, an affirmation that neither side will resort to force or threat of use of force, steps to demilitarize Kashmir, and mutual withdrawal from Siachen. Earlier, indirectly accusing India for its instability, Sharif said in his United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) speech, Wisdom dictates that our immediate neighbor refrains from fomenting instability in Pakistan. The two countries should address and resolve causes of tension and take all possible measures to avert further escalation. Countering Sharif s charges, Swarup said, Pakistan s instability arises from its breeding of terrorists. Blaming neighbours is not a solution. Sharif in his speech also suggested a new peace initiative between the two countries. One of the ways to achieve peace, according to him, was to demilitarize Kashmir. Apart from this, he also wanted unconditional and mutual withdrawal from Siachen Glacier, the world s highest battle ground. Swarup seem to have reacted to this in his tweet To de militarize Kashmir is not the answer, to de terrorize Pakistan is. In another tweet, he said Pakistan is not primary victim of terrorism but of its own policies. It is in fact the prime sponsor of terrorism. Separately, Pakistan PM Sharif on September 30, proposed a new four point peace initiative which includes demilitarisation of Kashmir and unconditional withdrawal of forces from Siachen, reports The Times of India. Addressing the UNGA, he also proposed restraint by both countries from use or the threat of use of force under any circumstances and formalisation of the 2003 border ceasefire as part of the formula to ensure peaceful ties between the two nuclear armed neighbours. Sharif suggested four ways in this initiative. I want to use this opportunity today to propose a new peace initiative with India starting with measures that are simplest to implement, he said. Sharif s four points We propose that Pakistan and India formalize and respect the 2003 understanding for a complete ceasefire on the Line of Control in Kashmir. For this purpose, we call for UNMOGIP expansion to monitor the observance of ceasefire. We propose that Pakistan and India reaffirm that they will not resort to the use or the threat of use of force under any circumstances. This is a central element of the UN charter. Steps must be taken to demilitarize Kashmir Agree to unconditional mutual withdrawal from Siachen Glacier, the world s highest battle ground."
