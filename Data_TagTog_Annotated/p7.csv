However, substantial number of forces was withdrawn from Assam following the last Assembly elections and that is why the State Government has requested the Centre to send additional forces to deal with the situation.The Special Director General of Police (Law and Order) Kula Saikia admitted that as the militant groups are not in a position to create trouble alone, they are trying to regroup and work under one umbrella. He said the militants are trying to shift their modus operandi and they have started to try and use more explosives.

This fact came out during the questioning of 14 suspected Islamic State (IS) sympathisers who were arrested last week from 12 places in six cities in a synchronized raid conducted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the sources added.

They were also trying to establish channels for procuring explosives and weapons,” the official source said. The leadership of Janood ul Khalifa e Hind, active since April 2015, was following the IM and SIMI set ups by choosing their organised central, state and city level core groups, the official said.
