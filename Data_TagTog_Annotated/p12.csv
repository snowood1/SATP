An undated document, which according to WikiLeaks, originated from the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in New Delhi, contains the list of Indian institutions and societies that have applied for financial assistance. The document suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia itself pledged donations to nine such institutions located across different states, including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala and Maharashtra. Saudi Arabia pledged 2.5 million Saudi Riyal (SR) to Islamic Mission Trust, Malpurram (Mallapuram) in Kerala, which is registered with the UMHA, ostensibly for constructing an arts and science college building. Similarly, it also pledged 1 million SR to the Kerala branch of Islamic Welfare Trust for constructing a nursing college. A similar amount was also pledged to the Palghat Mujahideen Arabic College Committee in Kerala for the purpose of extending an existing medical college and the Karuma hospital building. In Uttar Pradesh, 75,000 SR were pledged to two different societies for establishing a madrasa (Islamic seminary) building and establishing a vocational centre for girls in Mirzapur and Siddharth Nagar, respectively. WikiLeaks also released documents that showed that the Secretariat General of the Muslim World League (Mecca), a controversial organisation, had requested Saudi Arabia to encourage establishing Wahhabi centres in India. Sources in the MHA feel that the Saudi government is concerned about the growing influence of the Shia community in India and Iran s increasing closeness to India and sees this phenomenon as a threat to the majority Sunni population in the country, something that has been mentioned in their diplomatic correspondence which has been released by WikiLeaks.

The report said that “While ISIS runs amok in Syria and Iraq, demanding media attention through acts of barbarous cruelty, HuT (the Party of Liberation) is quietly building a global infrastructure of radicalised youth and deep pocketed Arab support in preparation for the global Khilafat,” The terrorist group has cleverly avoided any intense global scrutiny while spreading its ideology and support base in nearly 50 countries, said the report.

A classified intelligence report sent out by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009 details efforts by terrorists to “set off explosions and carry out terrorist attacks” in the two States and speculates that a terror team might have already arrived in Himachal Pradesh to carry out the attack. The detailed reports, drawn up by the US State Department’s Office of Intelligence and Threat Analysis, say that terror groups have been emboldened by the Mumbai attack and are planning attacks on Indian missions abroad and key infrastructure projects in Jammu and Kashmir. “India learned in late March that up to three or more teams of terrorists, at least some of whom are Kashmiris, are planning to set off explosions and carry out terrorist attacks in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. At least one terrorist team might already have arrived in Himachal Pradesh,” a cable sent out by Clinton on March 27, 2009 says. “The terrorists allegedly intend to carry out attacks seminal to those in Mumbai,” the report, released by WikiLeaks, adds. The same cable goes on to say that as of early 2009, the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) remained capable of carrying out attacks on mainland India though there was no information on the location or nature of the attacks. “Indeed, there is little reporting to suggest counter terrorism efforts by the Pakistanis have done anything to encumber LeT’s operational network in South Asia (Himachal Pradesh and Punjab located in northwest India),” it reads. Besides attacks in Punjab and Himachal, LeT was also planning attacks on “high profile infrastructure” in Jammu and Kashmir, the report suggests. “Terrorists may be planning attacks against civilian infrastructure sites in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Possible attack locations include several dams, power stations, and three airports Leh, Kargil, and Jammu Satwari,” the report says. A similar intelligence report sent out by Clinton in December 2008 in the aftermath of the Mumbai attack also says that the LeT was “likely capable” of conducting another attack in India in the coming months. It also reveals that India shared concerns with the US that its missions abroad would be attacked by Pakistan based terror groups. While inputs in many cables point to the frustration in India over the lack of action by Pakistan against terror camps post the Mumbai attack, there is also a reference to intelligence sharing by Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) Chief Shuja Pasha on possible threats against Israeli targets in India."
