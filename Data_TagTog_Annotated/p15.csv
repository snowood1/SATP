One of the key plotters of 26 11, Pakistani American David Coleman Headley, the report noted had previously come to the attention of US law enforcement authorities but FBI officials repeatedly concluded that Headley did not pose a threat at the time. The increasingly complex and dangerous threat environment it faces will require no less, said the report which studied FBI investigations into five significant terrorism events. In none of those cases did a confidential source provide actionable intelligence to help prevent or respond to a terrorist operation, the report said. In December 2007, Headley s Moroccan wife complained to US officials at the US Embassy in Islamabad (Capital of Pakistan) that her husband was a terrorist. But the FBI investigation of Headley did not begin until 2009, and it was triggered by a tip that originated outside the FBI that revealed his relationships with extremists abroad, the report said. One of the main lessons from the Headley case is that absent an intelligence effort across the US Intelligence Community to understand the connections among cases and complaints across field offices, relevant intelligence may fall by the wayside, it said. News outlets, it noted, have reported, prior to his terrorist activities, Headley had worked as a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) informant in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, following two heroin trafficking arrests. A single complaint may be more easily dismissed as a poison pen motive, but several unrelated complaints should not be dismissed as readily as the work of a malcontent, the report said. The Headley case raises the important question faced by all intelligence agencies certainly important to the FBI of how to scan and assess voluminous amounts of collected information strategically and identifying valuable intelligence leads, the report said. Still, more than a decade after 9 11, the FBI must prioritize empowering and equipping its analytic cadre to make these connections with cutting edge technology, to minimize the risk of the FBI missing important intelligence information, it said. The FBI had no knowledge of Headley s connections to Lashkar i Taiba (LeT) until provided with a tip that originated outside the FBI that prompted the investigation in 2009."

Tariq Khosa, a top police officer who was made Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) weeks after the 26 11 Mumbai terror attack, has written a revealing article in Dawn newspaper giving graphic details of the plot and its investigation, thereby confirming what India has been saying for long. Khosa, who has held top posts in the Pakistan Government and Interpol besides initiating criminal investigation into former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto s assassination in 2007, wrote that Pakistan has to deal with the Mumbai mayhem, planned and launched from its soil. This requires facing the truth and admitting mistakes. He also demanded that Pakistan s state security apparatus should ensure that the perpetrators and masterminds of the ghastly terror attacks are brought to justice. Noting that the case has lingered on for far too long, Khosa said dilatory tactics by the defendants, frequent change of trial judges and assassination of the case prosecutor as well as retracting from original testimony by some key witnesses have been serious setbacks for the prosecutors. The Asian Age adds that in his article in Dawn, Khosa stated, The following facts are pertinent. First, Ajmal Kasab was a Pakistani national, whose place of residence and initial schooling as well as his joining a banned militant organisation was established by the investigators. Second, the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) terrorists were imparted training near Thatta, Sindh and launched by sea from there. The training camp was identified and secured by the investigators. The casings of the explosive devices used in Mumbai were recovered from this training camp and duly matched. Third, the fishing trawler used by the terrorists for hijacking an Indian trawler in which they sailed to Mumbai, was brought back to harbour, then painted and concealed. It was recovered by the investigators and connected to the accused. Fourth, the engine of the dinghy abandoned by the terrorists near Mumbai harbour contained a patent number through which the investigators traced its import from Japan to Lahore and then to a Karachi sports shop from where a LeT linked militant purchased it along with the dinghy. The money trail was followed and linked to the accused who was arrested. Fifth, the ops room in Karachi, from where the operation was directed, was also identified and secured by the investigators. The communications through Voice over Internet Protocol were unearthed. Sixth, the alleged commander and his deputies were identified and arrested. Seventh, a couple of foreign based financiers and facilitators were arrested and brought to face trial. However, India feels that its stand is vindicated in the disclosures made by the Pakistani chief investigator of the 26 11 Mumbai attacks (2008) in a newspaper column that the terror strike was planned and launched from Pakistani soil, reports The Asian Age. Government sources said that We have always insisted that the 2008 terror attack were planned, financed and carried out by people from Pakistan. Also, it is our view that 99 per cent of the evidence in the Mumbai case is in Pakistan. They added that prosecutors in Pakistan had enough evidence against the perpetrators of the deadly attacks and that if they had revealed it the outcome of the trial would have been different, a reference to the fact that those responsible for it, including Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, are roaming free in Pakistan."

Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP, Kotli) Riyaz Mughal said that they had set up roadblocks at three points Dhanna, Seri and Chattar to prevent the marchers from nearing the LoC. When the group reached Dhanna village in some eight or so vehicles, they were intercepted by the Police. Mughal said despite being stopped some activists tried to make their way beyond the Police cordon following which they were taken into protective custody.

The detained activists were kept in Police Lines Kotli for several hours and were set free in the evening, Mughal added. The call to cross the dividing line from Khuiratta sector, which faces Jammu Province in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir, was given by NSF on a day April 28 when Karachi Agreement was signed in 1949 by the Kashmiri leaders to handover the administrative control of Gilgit Baltistan to the Government of Pakistan. NSF advocates complete freedom of the disputed Himalayan region. In 1990 the NSF had staged a massive march towards the LoC in Chakothi sector in the south of Muzaffarabad, choosing February 11, the death anniversary of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) founder Maqbool Bhat, for the crossing. Two of its activists had died in firing by the troops right at the LoC. In August 2007, the group attempted to cross a snowcapped route in Neelum Valley that connects PoK and Gilgit Baltistan and had lost another two activists, due to harsh weather. No one was hurt as Police contingents successfully overpowered the procession of at least 100 activists of the NSF, said Superintendent Police Ghulam Akber Chaudhry while talking to The Express Tribune.

In the summer of 2013, according to intercepts, Dawood was actively involved in discussions with his associates in the UAE regarding a residential cum commercial project in that country. He could have made 155 million dirham (Rs.279 crore) in profit if he had outright sold the apartments and shops. However, he was veering towards renting out the properties to earn about 30 million dirham (Rs.54 crore) as annual rent. He runs an office in Dubai, from where cheques and other payments are issued after instructions from him. He has been buying and selling property in the UAE market. For example, in early 2013, he bought a villa for 8.5 million dirham (Rs.15 crore). At the end of the year, Dawood floated a company in Dubai with his associates, where he had a 25 per cent stake. Around the same time, Dawood told his UAE associates about his 25 million dirham (Rs.45 crore) investment in properties, and also asked them to get a cheque of 50 million dirham (Rs.90 crore) for disbursing some payments."

For the past few years, the Chhattisgarh cadres have been unhappy over the continued presence of their colleagues from Telangana in their State and have been demanding that the Telangana Maoists return to their State and revive the movement.

Also, the plan calls for focus on 35 40 worse affected districts, where competent IAS IPS officers may be posted. Officers who do well in the four years may be rewarded with preferential postings, foreign deputations and foreign courses.
