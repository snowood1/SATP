Further, the DNA analysis of several items, including a red and blue jacket that was reportedly found on blast site, had helped ATS to zero in on the accused, reported on May 29. According to the chargesheet submitted by the ATS, DNA samples taken from a red and blue windcheater, and pillows and bedsheets seized from a flat in Kasarwadi, where the bombs were allegedly assembled, matched the DNA of blood samples of two of the suspects. According to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report, dated April 15, 2013, the DNA profile of the sweat traces found on the jacket and blood sample of suspect Feroz are identical and from one and the same source of male origin . DNA profile matches with the maternal and paternal alleles in the source . Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) has stated that each of the bombs carried about 500 to 750 gm of ammonium nitrate, two wrist watches, two or three detonators, two 9 Volt batteries and ball bearing sheet. Each bomb had a potential to cause massive damage over a 250 metre radius. If they had exploded with their full intensity, about 80 to 100 persons could have died and 200 more injured."
