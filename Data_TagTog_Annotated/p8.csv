He said he wanted to draw the attention to a dangerous situation that could be risen by hiding the facts and decided to disclose the facts regarding the IS rebels. Justifying his statement the Justice Minister said the even the international media in foreign countries publish the information related to individuals joining the IS in order to suppress the terrorist acts. However, some websites are publishing false news reports and causing damage to the independence of the country s judiciary as well eroding the confidence of the public in the judicial system, the Minister pointed out. The Justice Minister charged that a small number of journalists are using the situation to spread false news reports and create a media mafia. The Minister had informed the Parliament on November 18 that 32 well educated Sri Lankan Muslims of four families have joined the IS in Syria.Earlier, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL) had strongly objected to the statement made by the Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in Parliament regarding the Muslim community. Issuing a statement on November 19, MCSL president N M Ameen had said Minister s statement implies that 32 Muslims have joined the IS recently. We strongly object to this misplaced statement. The facts given by the Honorable Minister were reported in the media more than one year ago when a Sri Lankan combatant died fighting with ISIS. There have been no new reports of any others involved since this was reported last year, he pointed out. It is believed that one family had gone to Syria to provide humanitarian support to the war wounded and refugees. Some of the men are alleged to have joined or forced to join the fighting forces of ISIS. The Muslim community, including the Muslim Council, Jamiathul Ulema and other organizations cooperated with the government in identifying the families to provide the necessary support for the intelligence agencies to investigate. Those who have gone to Syria as quoted by Hon. Rajapakshe include women and children. he said. Ameen said the Minister s statement comes at a very opportune time to certain extremist elements bent on tarnishing the image of the Muslim community for reasons only best known to them. The Muslim community is seriously alarmed about the re emergence of the racist campaign that was carried out by extremist Buddhist monks since the end of the war in 2009. Many youth too have started social media campaigns against the Muslim community. The statements made by the Hon Minster would only help to disturb peace and promote the interests of certain vested interests to destroy our country. We urge the Hon Minister and the Government to investigate this and take appropriate action. We urge the government to take immediate steps to halt all form of extremism and restore peace and harmony for all Sri Lankans, the MCSL President said.Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena gave instructions to the law enforcement agencies and security services to arrest those who incite racism and religious extremism in the country and take legal action against them, Colombo Page reports on November 20.

He also said that “investigations” were going on to determine whether the paramilitary force had moved beyond its power in the Asad Kharal affair in Larkana. The CM’s stance emerged challenging the paramilitary force’s viewpoint about the powers as Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, Director General Major General Bilal Akbar had asserted only a few days ago that Rangers could move in any part of the province to chase criminals using their special powers given under the defined laws. “One should say that the Rangers are here to assist the police in maintaining law and order,” he said while speaking at a press conference in Larkana. “The Rangers were given powers for four heinous crimes — terrorism, targeted killing, extortion and kidnapping for ransom. They were authorised under certain circumstance to curb these crimes. Furthermore, they were given powers to operate only in Karachi and not in the entire province.”Earlier, the Federal Minister of Interior Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan wrote a letter to the Sindh CM, asking him to extend the policing powers of Rangers in the province, adds Dawn. “Unnecessary delay in extension of power to Rangers in Sindh will not only disrupt operation against terrorists but also negatively impact the morale and performance of the civil armed forces,” the minister said.

Yasin and Abdul Jabbar to Kashmir in September 2008 and handed them over to an LeT operative. The youths were allegedly being taken to an LeT camp for training but four of them were killed in an encounter with Indian security forces. Abdul Jabbar, the only one to escape, was later arrested by Kerala Police.The killing of the four and the investigations around their presence in Kashmir led investigators to unravel the mystery behind the Bengaluru blasts, which were allegedly executed withLeT funding, with Sabeer allegedly acting as the key Indian conduit in channelling funds and mobilising men for the Pakistan based terror organisation.According to the NIA, he used the passport of a daily wager, ShameerKollamkudyAlikutty, who is still living in Kerala, to escape. The NIA has found an airport departure card, which showed that he left for Dubai on an Air India flight. “In the departure card, the country of residence has been mentioned as the UAE whereas the occupation was written as sales executive,” the NIA says. The fake passport was later found in a hotel on Kish Island in Iran, a few months after Sabeer left.Agencies also suspect that Sabeer’s “escape” was facilitated by the then keyLeT commander for the India region, RehanaliasWalialias Abdul Aziz alias Rashid Abdullah, who has also been linked to the 26 11 Mumbai terror attack. Wali is also been named along with Sabeer in the plot to recruit Kerala youths for terrorism."

AP Police, which filed a reply in the High Court, in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) submitted by Civil Liberties Committee, said that the incident of firing took place outside of the territory of AP, in Odisha. In the reply, Visakhapatnam Rural District Superintendent of Police (SP) Rahul Dev Sharma said that on October 24, they got information about the presence of Maoists in the AOB (Andhra Odisha Border) and Police parties of Odisha and AP reached the forest area of Ramagurah . On seeing the police parties, the Maoists, who were armed with latest automatic weapons, opened fire on the police parties resulting in injuries to two Greyhound Commandos, and one of them died. Despite the police calling upon the Maoists to surrender, they did not pay heed to the warning and continued firing, constraining the police parties to retaliate by counter firing in self defence, the SP said. As a result of this firing incident, some Maoists died and some more escaped. The incident was reported at Chitrakonda Police Station of Malkangiri District and a case was registered, which is under investigation by the Odisha Police. On ascertaining from the Chitrakonda Police, it was revealed that they found 24 bodies at the scene of offence (13 men and 11 women), the SP added. Civil rights activists had earlier moved the high court and filed a PIL seeking a thorough judicial probe into the incident. Advocate V Raghunath, on behalf of Civil Liberties Committee, had filed the litigation and demanded registration of murder cases against the AP Police. Seeking dismissal of the petition, Sharma said in the reply, Police have not violated the law and the incident of firing has taken place in Odisha and is being investigated into. The writ petition seems to have been filed by twisting the facts of a legitimate joint combing exercise and the counter firing in self defence. The court posted the matter for further hearing to November 8."
