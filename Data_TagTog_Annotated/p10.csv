During my very brief association, Budhwa Pahan, an aide of Kundan Pahan, raped me four times,” Basanti said. “One foreign made pistol, 40 gelatine sticks, more than 50 live cartridges and one vehicle has been recovered, SSP Singh added."

The deal, endorsed by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, was put in place after NSCN K abrogated a ceasefire pact with GoI. Intelligence sources said the deal involved engaging NSCN K dissidents Wangting Naga and P Tikhak, who were expelled by the group in March. The two dissidents met Indian intelligence officials at Dimapur on March 27, where they were informed that New Delhi found NSCN K ‘chief’ Khaplang’s provision of military infrastructure to other North east insurgent groups unacceptable. The men were asked to push their chief to resume the ceasefire and join peace talks. Khaplang, however, rejected pleas from Naga and Tikhak, and expelled them from the organisation. The decision marked a split between the India based leadership of the NSCN K, and its ranks across the border in Myanmar, who had, in 2012, signed a separate peace treaty with that country’s army, and believed themselves secure in their bases there. New Delhi’s decision to work with NSCN K dissidents, intelligence officials say may have provoked Khaplang to resume attacks on Indian forces. Also, Khaplang has emerged as the most important insurgent leader in North East region, reports The Times of India on June 9.

The US administration has indicated that the US will act unilaterally if Pakistan does not comply, The Washington Post reported. Quoting officials, the paper said the message was delivered in high level meetings and public statements over the past several days reflecting Washington’s view that the year long strategy of using persuasion and military assistance to influence Pakistan’s behaviour has been ineffective. Meanwhile, a US Senate committee voted to make economic and security aid to Pakistan conditional on its cooperation in fighting militants. The Senate committee did not specify any amount for economic aid to Pakistan for fiscal 2012, leaving it up to the Obama administration to set the level and notify Congress or provide nothing at all. If the administration wants to provide zero, that d be OK with us, said Republican Senator Mark Kirk, one of the more vocal critics of Pakistan on the panel. The committee did approve USD 1 billion for the Pakistan Counter insurgency Capability Fund, which was created in 2009 to help Pakistan s military develop counter insurgency capabilities to fight Islamist militants within its borders. But the committee voted to make this aid, as well as any economic aid that is provided, conditional on Pakistan s cooperating with Washington against several militant groups. The restrictions were part of a foreign aid bill that the committee approved and sent to the Senate floor. It will have to be reconciled with the House of Representatives, where lawmakers in one subcommittee have voted similar restrictions. Pakistan also gets US military aid via the Pentagon budget. But Washington is already withholding USD 800 million of that aid this year as ties have come under mounting strain. Washington has allocated about USD 20 billion for Pakistan over the last decade.

18891,False,,,,,,,pakistan,2014,"A downward trend in the number of overall incidents of violence, which had started in 2010 and continued in the two subsequent years, could not persist in 2013 reported The News on January 5. It took a slight upward curve during the campaign for the 2013 general election and sustained until the year’s end. This was revealed in the Pakistan Security Report 2013, produced and recently released by an Islamabad based research institute Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). According to the PIPS report, militant, nationalist insurgent and violent sectarian groups carried out a total of 1,717 terrorist attacks across Pakistan in 2013, claiming the lives of 2,451 people and causing injuries to another 5,438. As compared to 2012, the number of reported terrorist attacks in Pakistan in 2013 posted a nine per cent increase while the number of people killed and injured in these attacks increased by 19 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively. The major actor of instability in the country in 2013 was the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Despite the killing of some of its top leaders in Drone attacks and also military operations launched by Pakistani Security Forces (SFs), the operational capabilities of the group remained intact. An alliance of numerous militant groups and commanders, TTP proved lethal in 2013 as it carried out 645 terrorist attacks in 50 Districts across the country, claiming the lives of 732 civilians and 425 SFs personnel. A rise in sectarian violence that started in 2011 continued through 2012 towards the end of 2013. While the overall incidents of sectarian violence, including sectarian related attacks and clashes, posted a slight increase in 2013 as compared to 2012, the number of people killed and injured in these incidents significantly increased. The number of suicide attacks across the country rose by 39 per cent, with 46 suicide attacks in 2013 compared to 33 in 2012. As many as 18 (39 per cent) out of the total suicide attacks in 2013 were recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 12 in Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA), 9 in Balochistan, 5 in Sindh and 1 each in Rawalpindi and Azad Kashmir. Of the total, 34 suicide attacks were perpetrated by the TTP and other similar militant groups, 9 were sectarian related mainly carried out by Lashkar e Jhangvi (LeJ) and 1 suicide blast was carried out by nationalist insurgents. Another 2 attacks were carried out in inter militant clashes. US Drone strikes in Pakistan’s tribal areas registered a 31 per cent decrease in 2013 compared to the previous year and fatalities in these attacks also fell by 39 per cent. Out of 31 reported Drone attacks in 2013, as many as 24 struck militants and their hideouts in North Waziristan Agency, in FATA. Five Drone strikes were reported in South Waziristan, and one each in Khyber Agency and Hangu, a settled District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The number of overall cross border attacks and clashes increased in 2013, particularly along Pak India border (including the Line of Control and the working boundary), but the casualties in these attacks decreased. Most of the cross border attacks and clashes (68, or 66 per cent) were reported from Pakistan’s border with India 26 and 9 attacks, respectively, were reported from Pakistan’s borders with Afghanistan and Iran. On the whole, 103 border attacks and clashes were reported from Pakistan’s borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran, which were 30 percent more than such incidents in 2012. As many as 59 Pakistani citizens, including personnel of security forces and civilians lost their lives in these incidents, 82 per cent less than the killings in such incidents in 2012. The incidents of ethno political violence in Pakistan increased by 22 per cent, from 183 in 2012 to 224 in 2013, but the fatalities in these incidents slightly decreased from 288 in 2012 to 283 in 2013. While most incidents of ethno political violence in 2013 were concentrated in Karachi (over 81 per cent), such incidents were reported from a total of 28 districts in all four provinces of Pakistan. It was apparently due to the May 2013 elections that the ethno political violence in the country became more complex with increasing number of political parties becoming either part of it or being targeted in politically motivated targeted killings. Despite a decrease in fatalities in 2013 in the overall incidents of violence, the number of civilians killed in these incidents increased by 16 per cent and of civilians injured by 34 per cent. However, the number of militants killed in 2013 in overall incidents of violence declined by 28 percent. Fatalities among SFs personnel also modestly decreased, by almost two per cent."

In between, he did a course in intelligence in 2003. I did the basic the religious course in the beginning. I did a preliminary course, a military. And then I did the advanced course. Then I did the intelligence course. Then I did the anti terrorist course. Then I did the leadership course. And that s it, Headley told the court in response to a question from the defence attorney. All these courses, he said, were directed towards fighting in Jammu and Kashmir.
