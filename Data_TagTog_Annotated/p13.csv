RPN Singh said there were 1000 attempts of infiltration by militants from Pakistan and PoK through the LoC between 2010 12. Singh informed Lok Sabha that 160 militants were killed by Security Forces (SFs) while trying to infiltrate while 570 others went back to the other side of the border due to strict vigil by SFs. However, he said, 95 terrorists could infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir in 2010, 52 could infiltrate in 2011 and 121 could infiltrate in 2012. The Minister said J K has been facing Pakistan sponsored terrorism, spearheaded by Pakistani intelligence agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) for more than 20 years. The reason for increase in terror attacks is due to stepping up of the attack on security forces planned by the militant groups in the aftermath of Afzal Guru s execution in February 2013, RPN Singh told Lok Sabha in a written reply on August 6, reports Times of India. Giving statistics, Singh said that in 2012, there were 50 incidents of encounters between militants and Security Forces in J K in which 15 security personnel were killed and 65 were injured. In 2013 (up to July 28), there were 16 incidents of encounters in which 35 security personnel were killed 29 were injured. However, the casualties were not merely the result of the belligerence of militants there were also security lapses. In most of the cases of casualties, the laxity and non adherence to standard operating procedures by SFs have also been evident, Singh said. The figures show that in just seven months of this year, casualty on the side of SFs had more than doubled. Sources said this was also due to an increased thrust from Pakistan on infiltration across the border which grew by close to 80 this year."
