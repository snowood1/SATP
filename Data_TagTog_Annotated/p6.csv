India s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin strongly rejected remarks by Pakistan s envoy Maleeha Lodhi, who said during a General Assembly debate on Report of the Secretary General on the Work of the Organisation that India has created conditions that pose a threat to peace and security in the region by its recent declarations and actions. Akbaruddin responded sharply by saying that Pakistan s claims in the UN are finding no resonance and it should abandon its quest for Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. Our response to Pakistan is consistent. Abandon your futile quest. The state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and will remain so, Akbaruddin said asserting that no amount of misuse of international platforms by Pakistan will change that reality. The sell by date of Pakistan s anachronistic approach is long over, he said. Akbaruddin said claims by Pakistan, a global epicentre of terrorism, on Kashmir find no resonance amongst the international community, with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif raising the Kashmir issue in his General Assembly address also finding no support. We have heard one such lone voice again a short while ago, making claims to an integral part of my country. This comes from a country which has established itself as the global epicenter of terrorism. Such claims find no resonance amongst the international community, he said. The Indian envoy emphasised that during the recently concluded high level UN General Debate, there was a singular lack of support for Sharif s baseless claims . Need one say more, he said."
