33396,False,,,,,,,srilanka,2016,"Sri Lanka’s internal war which ended in May 2009 had cost the country around USD 200 billion according to India’s former National Security Adviser (NSA) and Foreign Secretary, Shivshankar Menon, reports Colombo Gazette on December 13. In his book ‘Choices Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy’, Menon says that this estimate does not include the “opportunity cost” to Sri Lanka which was once the fastest growing and the most open economy in South Asia. About deaths, the veteran Indian diplomat turned security expert says that between 1983 and 2009, 80,000 to 100,000 people, including combatants from both sides, lost their lives. Among them were 30,000 to 50,000 civilians, 27,693 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) cadres, 23,790 Sri Lankan Army personnel, and 1,155 men of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF).The final stages of the war had created a little over 300,000 refugees or Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). The war had also left 1.6 million land mines in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. But the real casualty of the war was Sri Lanka’s composite society, something that the LTTE and Sinhala chauvinism are “equally responsible for”, Menon says. “Sri Lanka’s democracy was flawed by disappearances, killings, torture, detention, and widespread human rights abuses committed by all sides in the war. Civil military relations were skewed, Sinhala society was militarized, and the brutalized remnants of Tamil civil society were leaderless, without direction or hope. Nor was there any sign of an attempt to come to terms with the legacy and result of the war, to undertake real reconciliation,” he observes grimly. Menon points out that LTTE ‘chief’ Prabhakaran had left his Sri Lankan Tamil community “gutted and brutalized” by his war."

30668,False,,,,,,,india,2016,"Intelligence alerts on terrorist threats in Delhi were 50 per cent down over the past five years, Hindustan Times reports on December 11. Experts cautioned that the declining number didn’t mean New Delhi has become less vulnerable to attacks, especially from Pakistan based militant outfits such the Jaish e Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar e Taiba (LeT). The Jaish and Lashkar enjoy patronage from the Pakistani establishment and army, and are involved in this year’s Pathankot air base and Uri army camp attacks in which about two dozen Indian soldiers were killed. Pakistan denies the charge.The Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Research and Analysis Wing (R AW) alerted Delhi Police 306 times about possible terrorist attacks since 2012, which recorded the highest number of warnings at 77. In comparison, only 29 alerts have surfaced till September, 2016 a Delhi Police response to a right to information query revealed. “Broadly, we can divide these inputs into two parts. One is of general nature. Say possibilities of attack during Independence Day and Republic Day. We circulate these inputs to keep our forces on the toes,” a senior Delhi police officer said. He added, “The second type is specific. For instance, X person is coming to Delhi and staying in a particular hotel. We investigate and report back to the agency about the authenticity of the alert. No information is available on the authenticity of each and every alert.”Another aspect attributed to the decreasing alerts is the growing presence of Islamic State (IS) and al Qaeda sympathizers, and home grown militants. Intelligence agencies don’t share alerts in such cases, but take action with the help of local Police. Delhi Police arrested about a dozen militants in 2016; among them six IS sympathisers and two are from the al Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). “None of them came directly from Pakistan. Agencies get information about Pakistan based terrorist through local informers and technical intervention such as call interception, including months of work such as data encryption as ISIS members interact through social media,” an officer said. Such cases go beyond the realm of alert, but invite actionable input that requires direct collaboration between the intelligence agency and police to arrest the militant. “That explains why number of terrorism related alerts is going down, though IS members are getting arrested increasingly,” the officer said."

Good terrorists are the ones that attack your neighbours; bad terrorists are the ones who attack you. This type of approach is enormously short sighted. The blowback is going to be bad. Terrorism will bite like a snake whoever feeds it, he added. Terrorism will bite probably like a snake. States need to have a common perspective, he warned. Ghani also said the threat of terrorism is not a passing threat, and that terrorist organisations change very rapidly, even if their objectives remain the same.He also categorically hit out at those using religion to justify terrorist acts, saying Islam does not condone terrorism. A tiny minority cannot be allowed to hijack a civilization and a religion. There is no terrorism in the past 160 years except for adherence, practitioners from every civilization that we take. So, there is no reason to demonize a certain civilization. But on the other hand, members of that community have an obligation to speak truth to violence, Ghani said. It is unacceptable to speak in the name of Islam. Islam does not allow for terrorism. Terrorism must be condemned and we must stand together to contain it. Extremism cannot be permitted a platform. This is denial of everything that we stand for, and everything that civilization has stood for, he added.He also stressed that Afghanistan does not allow terrorists to launch attacks from its soil, despite the fact that it is under attack.Ghani said that south Asia is reeling under two wars — one in Afghanistan which is not a civil war and the other in Pakistan. However, he said, the war in Pakistan is not being covered adequately by the media. Around 2,700 (Pakistani) forces moved to the north western province and also Balochistan; this violence needs to be covered (by media) as people need to talk about it to address it, Ghani said while answering questions. However, to a specific question on whether he would support the independence movement in Balochistan, he said his country and his government do not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. We respect international norms, Ghani said even as he maintained that if people in these regions are not happy, there is a constitutional framework within Pakistan and that should be able to address the issue. However, in a veiled attack on Pakistan s use of force, he said Forces do not keep people together, rights and connectivity do.

Narendra Modi went to Pakistan and Pathankot happened. Now Pakistan is fuelling unrest in the Valley,” she said, adding India has extended hand of friendship to Pakistan sincerely but it was not reciprocated by the neighbouring country.Taking on the separatists and other “influential people” fuelling unrest in Kashmir, Mehbooba charged them with “driving innocent children and youth” to the path of violence by making them stone pelters and forcing them to target Security Forces (SFs) and camps and Police Stations but, at the same time, sending their own kin to different parts of India for studies. “What we will do with the Medical and Engineering Colleges, if they don’t produce doctors and engineers if the vested interests continue to drive children and youth to the path of stone pelting”?, she asked saying the Colleges are meant for studies to produce professionals and it should be duty of all right thinking people to send their wards to the educational institutions and not the “institutes of stone pelters”. “Students shouldn’t be on the roads. Their place is in the educational institutions. If the students continue to be on the roads, there will be no doctors and engineers,” she said.Taking “perpetrators of violence” to task, the CM called upon them to come forward and don’t hide behind the shield of youth and children. “Let them come forward and show their real face to the people of Kashmir that they are making the innocent youth and children stone pelters by ruining their careers of education,” she said, declaring that there will be no talks with those indulging in violence or instigating the youth to the path of stone pelting. “We will hold talks only with those, who give up the violence”.

As people were engaged in protest rallies in Kashmir, some miscreants took advantage of it,” she said, adding shops and houses were illegally constructed and wood from forests was being smuggled. “We have only land that is available to us where we can make projects in the future,” the CM said. She said she had heard that “huge encroachments” had taken place in Jammu region also where some people took advantage of the unrest in Kashmir “as most of Government setup is focused towards it”. Calling upon the civil administration to go hard on “land mafia”, the CM, pointing towards the Divisional Commissioner, said the administration should go all out against the encroachments and ensure that the people didn’t manage to take advantage of the Kashmir unrest.“There are not only poor people who are engaged in encroachments but there are big guns engaged in these encroachments. You need to focus on them and remove encroachments,” she told the civil administration. “The authorities in Jammu should take a call and ensure that the illegal constructions are removed and no fresh encroachment should come up,” Mehbooba said."

In the final report of the case filed before the NIA Court, the NIA has included Dawood Ibrahim’s henchman Aftab Batki, who heads the FICN network of the gang, as accused. A red corner notice by the Interpol is pending against Aftab.The conspiracy pertaining to the smuggling of fake currency notes through the Nedumbassery airport started in October 2012. It all began when Manjeri native Kunjumuhammad who was lodged in the Arthur Road Prison, Mumbai, in connection with a narcotic case struck a deal with Kasargode native K M Abdullah who was accused in the sensational Hamza murder case. “Abdullah gave Kinjumuhammed the mobile number of Aftab, who handles Dawood’s fake currency business across India with many cases pending against him,” stated the NIA report.Later, Abdullah introduced Kunjumuhammed to Antony Das of Valparai, Coimbatore, and Perinjanam native Muhammed Haneefa, and they hatched the conspiracy to smuggle high quality fake currency notes from the Gulf to India. In October 2012, Antony Das invested 4 lakh for the operation, and sent the money to Kunjumuhammed who was in West Asia.Kunjumuhammed then contacted Aftab in Pakistam and arranged the fake Indian currency notes that were in the safe custody of Mohammed Haneefa in Dubai. Later, Kunjumuhammed arranged Abid Chullikulavan as carrier of the fake currency notes with the help of Abdul Salam, and offered him 50,000 as commission. In January 2013, Customs officials arrested Abid when he arrived at the Nedumbassery airport with the fake Indian currency notes, handed over to him by Antony Das.According to the NIA report, “counterfeiting of high quality Indian currency notes is rampant by Dawood Ibrahim’s crime syndicate, with the aim of weakening the Indian economy.” A former NIA official said investigation of many cases registered in other parts of country had established the nexus between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Dawood’s crime syndicate. “The fake notes are printed using highly sophisticated machines set up exclusively for the purpose. Even the minutest details of the original Indian currency notes are duplicated with perfection. So far, Pakistan is the only country where fake Indian currencies are found to have been printed,” added the report."

According to MultiAgency Centre (MAC) figures, 83 militants, mostly belonging to LashkareToiba (LeT), have infiltrated into Kashmir this year till August while last year the number was 35 for the whole year. However, a senior security force officer said that it is a conservative estimate and the figure could be higher than official figure as since July 8, after the killing of HizbulMujahideen (HM) ‘commander’, Burhan Wani, the security agencies are not getting accurate picture about recently infiltrated militants. The officer said that some of the recently infiltrated groups are yet to come under Security Forces (SFs) radar. Some of these militants are still in North Kashmir’s forest areas near the LoC while others have managed to reach the hinterland unnoticed. The infiltration attempts are still going on despite the surgical strikes against the militant launch pads in PoK at Dudniyal in Kail, Neelam, Leepa, Bhimber and Tata Pani. At Dudniyal in Kail area, the LeT suffered major damage where lot of their cadre who were planning to infiltrate were killed. Sources said that despite the surgical strikes the militant training camps are still active in PoK with 19 of them most active including those at Skardu, Kel, Karko, Dullu, Titwal, Chakoti, Kotli, Dehri, Barhal Mirpur and Chaprai. In these training camps, the militants are receiving rigorous training besides map reading, global positioning system (GPS) use, weight, weapon and tactical training. They said that over 200 militants are still waiting at launch pads for infiltration before the onset of winter but now they are alert. The militant leaders want to push in more infiltrators this year ahead of winter as security forces achieved major success against militants this year by eliminating over 115 of them so far. Army has intensified its vigil along the LoC and already two Brigades of Army have been sent to LoC in North Kashmir to take on the infiltrated militants and one more Brigade of Army has been sent to South Kashmir after increased militancy in the area. Militants taking advantage of the unrest have recruited locals into militancy and have activated their Over Ground Workers (OGWs) as well. The involvement of locals into militancy is a major challenge for the security agencies."
