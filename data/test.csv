"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on March 7 warned that the SIM cards becoming the new national security risk, reports Times of India. The information came out that many of the SIM cards being used by nearly 700 million mobile users in the country may have malevolent embedded software, which has put India s security agencies on tenterhooks. This new national security risk has alarmed the MHA and it intends to ask the telecom industry to replace all such imported SIMs in the country with locally manufactured ones at their own cost. According to a Government source, only 30 of the total volumes of SIM cards are imported at present, though even this figure will now be subjected to a formal evaluation of installed capacity. The fear is that the embedded software turns the SIM card into a minicomputer, which can be a cause of abuse. The security agencies are proposing that only blank SIM cards be allowed for import and the personalization process be done entirely by domestic firms. However, since this can only reduce vulnerability of future imports, MHA wants the industry to replace all existing SIMs at its own cost. The MHA also wants the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) to weed out all fake and duplicate IMEI numbers, indicating that its earlier crackdowns have not been entirely successful.",False,False,False,False,False

"Secret intelligence reports that have come to light in leaked US diplomatic cables pointed to efforts by “Kashmiri terrorists” to conduct November 26, 2008 Mumbai (26 11) style attacks in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab after the 26 11 attack, reports Indian Express. A classified intelligence report sent out by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009 details efforts by terrorists to “set off explosions and carry out terrorist attacks” in the two States and speculates that a terror team might have already arrived in Himachal Pradesh to carry out the attack. The detailed reports, drawn up by the US State Department’s Office of Intelligence and Threat Analysis, say that terror groups have been emboldened by the Mumbai attack and are planning attacks on Indian missions abroad and key infrastructure projects in Jammu and Kashmir. “India learned in late March that up to three or more teams of terrorists, at least some of whom are Kashmiris, are planning to set off explosions and carry out terrorist attacks in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. At least one terrorist team might already have arrived in Himachal Pradesh,” a cable sent out by Clinton on March 27, 2009 says. “The terrorists allegedly intend to carry out attacks seminal to those in Mumbai,” the report, released by WikiLeaks, adds. The same cable goes on to say that as of early 2009, the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) remained capable of carrying out attacks on mainland India though there was no information on the location or nature of the attacks. “Indeed, there is little reporting to suggest counter terrorism efforts by the Pakistanis have done anything to encumber LeT’s operational network in South Asia (Himachal Pradesh and Punjab located in northwest India),” it reads. Besides attacks in Punjab and Himachal, LeT was also planning attacks on “high profile infrastructure” in Jammu and Kashmir, the report suggests. “Terrorists may be planning attacks against civilian infrastructure sites in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Possible attack locations include several dams, power stations, and three airports Leh, Kargil, and Jammu Satwari,” the report says. A similar intelligence report sent out by Clinton in December 2008 in the aftermath of the Mumbai attack also says that the LeT was “likely capable” of conducting another attack in India in the coming months. It also reveals that India shared concerns with the US that its missions abroad would be attacked by Pakistan based terror groups. While inputs in many cables point to the frustration in India over the lack of action by Pakistan against terror camps post the Mumbai attack, there is also a reference to intelligence sharing by Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) Chief Shuja Pasha on possible threats against Israeli targets in India.",False,False,False,False,False

"Officials used a secret counterterrorism fund to buy wedding gifts, luxury carpets and gold jewellery for relatives of Ministers and visiting dignitaries, according to documents seen by AFP, Times of India reported on January 24. The revelations cast a spotlight on high level corruption in Pakistan as the impoverished but nuclear armed country battles a surge in Taliban violence. The National Crisis Management Cell (NCMC) received some 425 million rupees (USD 4.3 million) from Government coffers from 2009 2013, according to files obtained by Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Daily News, and seen by AFP. During that time the Federal Minister of Interior was headed by Rehman Malik, a flamboyant loyalist of former President Asif Ali Zardari s Pakistan People s Party (PPP). Many of the documents deal with payments to intelligence sources, routine maintenance of vehicles and overtime for employees.

A set of 21 carat gold jewellery worth $3,000 was bought for one unnamed individual, while another was the recipient of a USD 1,500 set. A handicrafts store in Islamabad was paid some USD 23,000 in December 2012 for carpets and crafts given to local officials and delegations from the EU, Iran and India. Among the more bizarre items paid for from the fund was the USD 800 cost of four sacrificial goats, plus butchery costs — listed as stabbing charges — for the festival of Eid ul Adha.
